# simple-vlc-player-for-tvos
This is a sample project using a compiled and working version of TVVLCKit library, from the VLC team. It can be a reference for developers to start a project that needs a good multi-format media player.

# Notes
Github doesn't admit large files so TVVLCKit has to be added separately.
Download the TVVLCKit from this link and decompress:

Move the "TVVLCKit" folder inside the "Libraries" folder
